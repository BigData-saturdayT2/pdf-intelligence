# Assignment 2: PDF Extractor with IBM Watson and FastAPI Integration

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Assignment 2**: a PDF extraction and query tool, which automates the extraction of data from PDF files using PyPDF2 and IBM Watson Discovery API. The system is designed to allow users to securely interact with the extracted data through a client-facing application built with **Streamlit** and **FastAPI**. Apache Airflow orchestrates the data pipelines for efficient automation.

## Data Flow and Architecture
Below is an overview of the data flow and ETL architecture used in the project:

## Problem Statement
The primary goal is to automate the extraction and processing of text from PDF files, making it easily accessible for querying and analysis. The project reduces the need for manual data extraction, enhancing efficiency and user interaction.

## Project Goals
- **Automated Text Extraction**: Implement extraction pipelines using PyPDF2 (open-source) and IBM Watson (enterprise) tools.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user access with FastAPI and JWT authentication.
- **Data Storage**: Store extracted text in AWS S3 and RDS for structured queries.
- **User Interface**: Build a Streamlit-based interface to allow users to interact with the extracted data.
- **Deployment**: Use Docker Compose to containerize the application for deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates the ETL pipeline for PDF processing.
- **IBM Watson Discovery**: Extracts structured data from PDFs.
- **AWS S3 & RDS**: Stores both raw and processed data.
- **FastAPI**: Manages user authentication and backend logic.
- **Streamlit**: Provides the frontend interface for data querying and interaction.
- **Docker**: Containerizes and deploys the system.
- **PyPDF2**: Performs open-source PDF text extraction.
